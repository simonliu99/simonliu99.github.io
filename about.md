Hello! I am a second-year medical student at the [David Geffen School of Medicine](https://medschool.ucla.edu) at the 
University of California Los Angeles. I am interested in machine learning and deep learning algorithms that improve 
patient outcomes. My recent work involves applying natural language processing and image classiciation for data 
extraction and disease identifiction. I was previously a postbaccalaureate fellow at the [National Human Genome Research 
Institute](https://www.genome.gov) in the Medical Genomics Unit under 
[Dr. Benjamin Solomon](https://www.genome.gov/staff/Benjamin-Solomon-MD).

I received a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from the Johns Hopkins University in 2021 and completed major requirements 
for Computer Science. I was nominated along with several other members of our social venture Health 3D for the Linda 
Trinh Memorial Award for our work in manufacturing face shields and other PPE for the Johns Hopkins Hospital System 
during the summer of 2020.

I have published several articles and also received the JHU AY 2021 Provost's Undergraduate Research Award to pursue an 
independent research project in developing novel image processing algorithms for an implantable cranial device.. For a 
complete list of my publications, please refer to my [CV](https://simonliu.dev/cv) or
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fwh_UDMAAAAJ).

In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering with servers and electronics in my homelab, managing a large server stack I use to 
host numerous services and game servers. I also enjoy weightlifting and kayaking among other outdoor activities.
